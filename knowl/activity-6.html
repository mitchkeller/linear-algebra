<div class="introduction"><p>We want to prove the theorem “If <span class="process-math">\(c,a,r\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(c\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\neq a/c\text{,}\)</span> then there exists a unique <span class="process-math">\(x\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\((ax+1)/(cx) =
r\text{.}\)</span>”</p></div>

<p>The first step in a uniqueness proof is to demonstrate that such a beast exists. One pattern for doing this is by coming up with a formula for the thing (here <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>) that we need to have exist and showing that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> does what it's supposed to. <em class="alert">The process of how you come with the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is scratchwork that doesn't go in the proof!</em>. Thus, we want to start by finding a formula for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\((ax+1)/(cx) = r\text{.}\)</span> Use familiar algebra skills to do it. What you write up for your proof is going to look like “Let <span class="process-math">\(x=\cdots\text{.}\)</span> Now substituting and simplifying, we see:” starting with <span class="process-math">\((ax+1)/(cx)\)</span> and simplifying to get <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>Next, we have to show that our <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is unique. To do so, you assume that <span class="process-math">\(x_1,x_2\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> both have the property required. Namely, that  <span class="process-math">\((ax_1+1)/(cx_1) =
r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((ax_1+1)/(cx_2) =
r\text{.}\)</span> Now you use algebra to show that <span class="process-math">\(x_1=x_2\text{,}\)</span> which means that the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> you came up with originally really is unique.</p>

<p>What you have above likely has a lot of scratchwork in it. Rewrite things neatly to have a nice paragraph that proves the theorem.</p>
