<p>The first step in a uniqueness proof is to demonstrate that such a beast exists. One pattern for doing this is by coming up with a formula for the thing (here <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>) that we need to have exist and showing that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> does what it's supposed to. <em class="alert">The process of how you come with the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is scratchwork that doesn't go in the proof!</em>. Thus, we want to start by finding a formula for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\((ax+1)/(cx) = r\text{.}\)</span> Use familiar algebra skills to do it. What you write up for your proof is going to look like “Let <span class="process-math">\(x=\cdots\text{.}\)</span> Now substituting and simplifying, we see:” starting with <span class="process-math">\((ax+1)/(cx)\)</span> and simplifying to get <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p>
