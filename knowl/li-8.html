<article class="li"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Theorem statements</span></h3>
<p>A statement that is true and for which we have a proof is a <dfn class="terminology">theorem</dfn>. As we go on, we will talk about related words such as “proposition”, “lemma”, and “corollary”, but those are all words that describe the role of a theorem. You can't go wrong by calling a true statement a thorem, so we will stick with that for the time being. Hutchings's essay somewhat silently transitions from statements of theorems that look like “For every integer <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is odd, then <span class="process-math">\(x+1\)</span> is even.” to theorem statements that look like “If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="process-math">\(x+1\)</span> is even.” When you see a theorem that appears to have a variable that doesn't have a quantifier attached, such as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in my second example, you assume a “for all” quantifier on that variable out in front of the implication. Mainly a convenience of mathematical writing.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_reading.html#li-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
