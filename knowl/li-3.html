<article class="li"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Negating statements</span></h3>
<p>We could get really deep into the weeds of something called truth tables for this, but to be honest, we just don't have the time for that. (It's also excruciatingly dull to do it.) However, I don't want some of these things to seem magical. One way to approach the negation of a statement is that the negation is true in exactly the circumstance(s) where the original statement is false. Let's take a look at a couple of important ones.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q\text{:}\)</span> This is true exactly when both are true. Thus, this is false when at least one statement is false. Hence, the negation is true when at least one statement is true. To shuffle the “not” around a bit, that means we need at least one of “not <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>” and “not <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>” to be true, so the negation is (not <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>) or (not <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(q\text{:}\)</span> This is true when at least one is true. Thus, this is false exactly when both statements are false. In this case, both “not <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>” and “not <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>” are true, so the negation is (not <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>) and (not <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(p\Rightarrow q\text{:}\)</span> This false exactly when <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is false. Thus, the negation is true in exactly this situation, which requires that both <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and (not <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>) be true, so <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and (not <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>) is the negation. We will see why this is important when we do proof by contradiction later on.</p></li>
