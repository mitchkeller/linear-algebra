<p>The elementary vectors of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vec{e_1},\vec{e_2}, ... ,\vec{e_n}\}\text{,}\)</span> form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{.}\)</span> Even better than that, the basis has only unit vectors and is orthogonal as a set (each pair of vectors is orthogonal to each other). These properties are very fundamental to how you worked with vectors before you started this class and why <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> has such nice geometric intuition built in. The fundamental idea of this section is understanding a procedure for how to <em class="emphasis">build</em> a basis that is an orthogonal set and has vectors of “length”  one.</p>
