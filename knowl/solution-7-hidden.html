<p>We already worked out what the image of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> was in an earlier problem and found that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{im}(T) = \{\frac{\beta+\gamma}{2} + \beta t + \gamma
t^2\colon \beta,\gamma\in\mathbb{R}\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice that we can rewrite the polynomials in the image to have the form <span class="process-math">\(\beta +
\gamma + 2\beta t + 2\beta t^2\text{,}\)</span> and grouping based on the scalar, we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\beta(1+2t) + \gamma(1+2t^2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Thus, every vector in the image is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(1+2t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1+2t^2\text{.}\)</span> I will leave it to you to verify that these vectors are linearly independent, but this shows that the rank of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is 2. (Since we have found a basis, this also answers the last part of this question.</p>
