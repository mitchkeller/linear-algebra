<p>If there exists a basis for a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vectors, then every basis of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> must have exactly <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vectors.</p></article><article class="proof"><h3 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h3>
<p>Assume by way of contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a vector space with bases <span class="process-math">\(S_0 = \{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S'=\{u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m\}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n\lt m\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(u_1\in V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_0\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> there are scalars <span class="process-math">\(c_i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle u_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i
v_i\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> is linearly independent, <span class="process-math">\(u_1\neq
\vec{0}\)</span> and at least one <span class="process-math">\(c_i\neq 0\text{.}\)</span> Without loss of generality, assume that <span class="process-math">\(c_1\neq 0\text{.}\)</span> Now let <span class="process-math">\(S_1 =
\{u_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}\text{.}\)</span> We claim that <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Notice that we can write</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn_u_i_plus_one.html ./knowl/eqn_u_i_plus_one.html">
\begin{equation*}
v_1 = \frac{1}{c_1}u_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n
\frac{-c_i}{c_1}v_i.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Thus, <span class="process-math">\(v_1\in span(S_1)\)</span> and so any vector in <span class="process-math">\(span(S_0)=V\)</span> can be written to demonstrate that it is also in <span class="process-math">\(span(S_1)\text{.}\)</span> To see that <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is linearly independent, suppose that</p>

Notice that if <span class="process-math">\(d_1=0\text{,}\)</span> then we have a nontrivial linear combination of vectors from <span class="process-math">\(S_0\)</span> that sums to the zero vector, which contradicts that <span class="process-math">\(S_0\)</span> is linearly independent. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(d_1\neq 0\text{.}\)</span> In this case, substitute <span class="process-math">\(u_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i

Since <span class="process-math">\(c_1\neq 0\neq d_1\text{,}\)</span> we now have a nontrivial linear combination of vectors from <span class="process-math">\(S_0\)</span> that sums to <span class="process-math">\(\vec{0}\text{,}\)</span> which contradicts that <span class="process-math">\(S_0\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> We will now show, as with using mathematical induction, that we can continue to move vectors from <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> into our basis. To do so, we assume for some <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(1\leq i\lt n\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(S_i=\{u_1,u_2,\dots,u_i,v_{i+1},\dots,v_n\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(S_{i+1}=\{u_1,u_2,\dots,u_{i+1},v_{i+2},\dots,v_n\}\)</span> is also a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(u_{i+1}\in
span(S_i)\text{,}\)</span> so there are scalars <span class="process-math">\(f_i\)</span> such that</p>

u_{i+1}=f_1u_1+f_2u_2+\cdots+f_iu_i+f_{i+1}v_{i+1}+\cdots+f_nv_n\text{.}\tag{4.1}

</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice that this requires some <span class="process-math">\(f_j\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(j\gt \)</span> be nonzero, as otherwise we would have written <span class="process-math">\(u_{i+1}\)</span> as a linear combination of elements of <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> (other than <span class="process-math">\(u_{i+1}\)</span>), which would mean that <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> is not linearly independent.

<p class="continuation">Notice that <span class="process-math">\(v_{i+1}\)</span> is not present in this sum, but otherwise this is a linear combination of elements of <span class="process-math">\(S_i\text{.}\)</span> Since <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn_u_i_plus_one.html" title="Equation 4.1">(4.1)</a> has a nonzero coefficient on <span class="process-math">\(v_{i+1}\text{,}\)</span> this is a different linear combination summing to <span class="process-math">\(u_{i+1}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> is not linearly independent, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p>Thus, we can produce a sequence <span class="process-math">\(S_0,S_1,S_2,\dots,S_n\)</span> of bases for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Notice that <span class="process-math">\(S_n=\{u_1,u_2,\dots,u_n\}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(u_m\)</span> is not in this set as <span class="process-math">\(m\gt
