<p>To prove that a function is onto, we take an arbitary element of the codomain and find an element of the domain that the function maps to the element of the codomain. We generally do this by first doing calculations on scratch paper and then demonstrating that the element of the domain “works” as our proof. For instance, consider the linear function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax+b\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(a\neq
0\text{.}\)</span> This function is onto. To prove this, let <span class="process-math">\(d\in\R\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(f\left(\frac{d-b}{a}\right)
=d\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
f\left(\frac{d-b}{a}\right) \amp =
a\left(\frac{d-b}{a}\right) +b \\
\amp= (d-b)+b\\
\amp = d\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since we have started with an arbitrary lement <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> of the codomain and found an element of the domain that is mapped to <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> we have proved that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is onto.</p>
<p>The codomain is essential to deciding if a function is onto. For instance, the function <span class="process-math">\(x\mapsto x^2\)</span> (with domain <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span>) is not onto if the codomain is <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> as there is no real number that squares to <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span> However, if we change the codomain to be all nonnegative real numbers, then the function is onto as it maps <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{d}\)</span> do <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> for all nonnegative real numbers <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#example-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
