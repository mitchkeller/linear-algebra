  <title>Introduction to mathematical arguments</title>
  <p>To prepare for class, we read (most of) the first portion of
  <q>Introduction to mathematical arguments</q> by Michael Hutchings,
  which is posted on Canvas. Here are some of the things in the
  reading I want to emphasize or say more about.
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>If&#8230;then</title>
      <p>We need some more vocab here. When considering <sq>if
      <m>p</m>, then <m>q</m></sq>, we call <m>p</m> the
      <term>hypothesis</term> and <m>q</m> the
      <term>conclusion</term>. Critical to our understanding later is
      that there is <em>exactly one circumstance</em> in which an
      if&#8230;then statement (sometimes called an
      <term>implication</term> or a <term>conditional
      statement</term>) is false: the hypothesis <m>p</m> is true and
      the conclusion <m>q</m> is false.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>If and only if</title>
      <p>This sort of statement is also called a <term>biconditional
      statement</term>. We usually prove <m>p\Leftrightarrow q</m> by
      proving <m>p\Rightarrow q</m> and separately that
      <m>q\Rightarrow p</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Negating statements</title>
      <p>We could get really deep into the weeds of something called
      truth tables for this, but to be honest, we just don't have the
      time for that. (It's also excruciatingly dull to do it.)
      However, I don't want some of these things to seem magical. One
      way to approach the negation of a statement is that the negation
      is true in exactly the circumstance(s) where the original
      statement is false. Let's take a look at a couple of important
      ones. 
      <ul>
	<li><m>p</m> and <m>q</m>: This is true exactly when both are
	true. Thus, this is false when at least one statement is
	false. Hence, the negation is true when at least one statement
	is true. To shuffle the <q>not</q> around a bit, that means we
	need at least one of <q>not <m>p</m></q> and <q>not
	<m>q</m></q> to be true, so the negation is (not <m>p</m>) and
	(not <m>q</m>).</li>
	<li>
	  <m>p</m> or <m>q</m>: This is true when at least one is
	  true. Thus, this is false exactly when both statements are
	  false. In this case, both <q>not <m>p</m></q> and <q>not
	  <m>q</m></q> are true, so the negation is (not <m>p</m>) and
	  (not <m>q</m>).
	</li>
	<li>
	  <m>p\Rightarrow q</m>: This false exactly when <m>p</m> is
	  true and <m>q</m> is false. Thus, the negation is true in
	  exactly this situation, which requires that both <m>p</m>
	  and (not <m>q</m>) be true, so <m>p</m> and (not <m>q</m>)
	  is the negation. We will see why this is important when we
	  do proof by contradiction later on.
	</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>

      <title>A note about quantifier symbols</title>
      <p>In this class, you will <em>never</em> use the symbols
      <m>\exists</m> or <m>\forall</m> in work submitted for
      grading. Never. If you do, you will not get full credit for the
      problem. As far as I am concerned, there are two settings where
      these symbols are useful: in courses in mathematical logic (MATH
      571, for instance) and in scratch work where a complicated
      statement is being negated. Once the scratchwork is done, you
      carefully write things using the proper words.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Theorem statements</title>
      <p>
	A statement that is true and for which we have a proof is a
	<term>theorem</term>. As we go on, we will talk about related
	words such as <q>proposition</q>, <q>lemma</q>, and
	<q>corollary</q>, but those are all words that describe the
	role of a theorem. You can't go wrong by calling a true
	statement a thorem, so we will stick with that for the time
	being. Hutchings's essay somewhat silently transitions from
	statements of theorems that look like <q>For every integer
	<m>x</m>, if <m>x</m> is odd, then <m>x+1</m> is even.</q> to
	theorem statements that look like <q>If <m>x</m> is an odd
	integer, then <m>x+1</m> is even.</q> When you see a theorem
	that appears to have a variable that doesn't have a quantifier
	attached, such as <m>x</m> in my second example, you assume a
	<q>for all</q> quantifier on that variable out in front of the
	implication. Mainly a convenience of mathematical writing.
